# Final Code Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook supports a research project detailed in the paper titled "Using Synthetic Data to Enhance Dark Pattern Research". This project investigates the application of synthetic data to improve the detection of deceptive design techniques in e-commerce, termed "dark patterns". The original dataset, which includes instances from various e-commerce sites, is expanded using synthetic data generation techniques such as CTGAN and Faker. This approach seeks to overcome the limitations related to the small size and lack of diversity in existing datasets, which hinder the development of robust detection algorithms. The research includes comprehensive analyses using machine learning techniques, offering insights into the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing dark pattern detection. This notebook encompasses the entire workflow, from data generation to model training and evaluation.
